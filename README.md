# Object_detection_system
This project employs YOLOV8, a state-of-the-art computer vision model, to detect aircrafts for air traffic analysis and operations.The analysis includes visualizing the frequency of detected flights over time, assessing the distribution of detection probabilities.The findings provide valuable insights into air traffic patterns and the model's performance for potential enhancements in airport operations.
